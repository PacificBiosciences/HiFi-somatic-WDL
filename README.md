## Installation and Dependencies

The workflow is written in WDL version 1.0 ([Workflow Description Language](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl)). It depends on `miniwdl` and `singularity` (version 3 and later). `miniwdl` can be installed using Bioconda. The workflow can also be run using `Cromwell`. (See [here](docs/step-by-step.md#is-the-workflow-compatible-with-cromwell) for instructions, tested on version 86).

## Usage

A step-by-step tutorial demonstrating usage and an FAQ can be found [here](docs/step-by-step.md).

## Important outputs from workflow

The workflow will generate the following results in the `$OUTDIR/_LAST/out` folder. Please refer to [output](docs/output.md) for a more detailed description of the outputs. In the table below, "Tumor/Normal" indicates the output is specific to tumor/normal mode and will not exist in the tumor-only mode. An example of final HTML report from COLO829 dataset can be found [here](examples/COLO829_60-30_summary_report.html?raw=1) (Right click to save the file and double click to open it in a web browser).

## Change logs

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand changelogs:</summary>

- v0.9.3a
  - Updated Wakhan to commit `a2dad42536475b6058d13253b4da7dbc8e4c4377`.
  - Removed unnecessary parameters in tumor-only example json.

- v0.9.3
  - Updated pbmm2 to 1.17.0 ([Changelog](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2?tab=readme-ov-file#full-changelog)). This will now work with with Vega dataset.
  - Added CPU arguments to `postprocess_variant` for DeepSomatic - This will fix the issue where in some
    HPC DeepSomatic will detect too many threads by default and causes it to run OOM.
  - Updated alignment stats summary logic so it will not run out of memory when there's a lot of reads. This 
    does not change the results compared to before.
  - Updated HiPhase to 1.5.0 which should reduce memory for phasing in some cases.
  - Increased default CPU for Severus and Wakhan to 24 (Can be modified with `sv_threads` and `wakhan_threads`)
  - Updated Severus to 1.6.0.
  - Updated Wakhan to commit `52d59c56be547bd93245a855c7aa5b6da35da691`. Note this is still experimental.
  - Added owl MSI caller and tumor mutational burden (TMB) estimate.
    - Note that these have not been tested on a large cohort, and we welcome feedbacks on these.
  - Decouple visualization script from reporting script.
  - Updated HPRC control SV calls to include additional samples from new relsease (Total of 232) and uses Severus 1.6 to re-call the SVs.
  - Fixed a bug in matepairs recovery after svpack filtering.
  - Updated Mitelman fusion database to July 10, 2025 release.
  - Improved circos plot for translocations breakpoints.
  - Added TMB estimate using annotated small variants.
  - Updated SV filtering so that when translocation involves one cancer gene and the other breakpoint doesn't,
    it'll still output both breakpoints in the filtered TSV (and in the final report).
  - Output breakpoints pairs involving genes in Mitelman fusions database.
  - Fixed VAF bug reported by [ljh-9809](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiFi-somatic-WDL/issues/17)

- v0.9.2
  - Updated DeepSomatic to 1.9.0. This should fixed the empty region issue with demo BAM.
  - Updated Severus to v1.5.0.
  - Fixed HMFtools database URL.
  - Fixed reporting bug reported by [Rhett Rhautsaw](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiFi-somatic-WDL/pull/19)

- v0.9.1
  - Fixed calculation of N50 read length (previously calculating L50).
  - Reduced memory usage of seqkit alignment summary.

- v0.9:
  - Tumor-only workflow is now supported. See [here](docs/step-by-step.md) for instructions.
  - Updated Severus to 1.3.
  - BND pairs can sometimes be missing due to svpack filtering just one of the pairs. The missing pair is now added back to the VCF.
  - Diploid phasing should now work on the DeepSomatic's VCF.
  - Added back MODERATE impact SNV/INDELs to the report.
  - Updated Compendium of Cancer Gene to 2024-9-30.
  - Added circos plot for structural variants BND events.
  - Removed Longphase as an optional phasing tool (HiPhase no longer fails due to OOM errors).
  - Added Wakhan output for CNV calling in both tumor-only and tumor/normal workflow. This is experimental and you can find the output
    in the `wakhan_cnv` folder.
  - Updated ClairS to 0.4.1 (Uses `hifi_revio_ssrs` model by default).

- v0.8.2:
  - Fixed a small bug in the report that causes the report to fail to render when there's zero variants.
  
- v0.8.1:
  - Move BND square bracket annotation for VCF to INFO field to avoid
    AnnotSV from harmonizing the BND format (Does not work well with long-reads SVs).
  - Fixed a bug preventing `skip_align` from working properly.
  - Added option to produce [SAVANA](https://github.com/cortes-ciriano-lab/savana) output. This is experimental and can be enabled with `hifisomatic.run_savana` in the input JSON.
    - Note that currrently the output for SAVANA is not annotated or used for any further downstream processing.
  - Updated Severus to 1.2.0.
  - `bcftools norm` on small variants before annotation.
  - Updated HiPhase to 1.4.5.
  - Updated reference list.
  
- v0.8:
  - Updated DeepSomatic to v1.7.0. This resulted in a significant improve in INDEL recall. See benchmark from DeepSomatic preprint for more comparisons.
  - Updated AnnotSV to 3.4.2. Please update AnnotSV cache by following the instructions in the step-by-step tutorial [here](docs/step-by-step.md).
  - Updated pbmm2 to 1.14.99 (With `-A2` option for better alignment of some complex SV with short supplementary segments, e.g. truthset_41 in COLO829).
  - Updated Severus to version 1.1.
    - Note that in COLO829 `truthset_19` becomes a FN with Severus 1.1. See issue [here](https://github.com/KolmogorovLab/Severus/issues/15).
  - Updated report format to become easier to read.
  - Resource bundle now uses germline SVs called with Severus instead of the previous Sniffles2 SV set. Please update resource bundle from Zenodo.
  - Simplified kinetics stripping directly in pbmm2.
  - Modified Amber to use the same pcf gamma as Cobalt. It was previously using a value of 100, while Cobalt was using 1000. 
    This change will make the segmentation more consistent between Amber and Cobalt and should improve purity/ploidy estimates.
  - Better logic with merging BAMs in the workflow (No more redundant merging when n_bam=1).
  - Suppressed a warning causing failures in Cobalt with CIGAR error in the BAM file. This is [known](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/issues/535).
  - Incorporated pull request from [here](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiFi-somatic-WDL/pull/6) for Cromwell on Azure (not tested).

- v0.7:
  - Updated DeepSomatic to v1.6.1.
  - Pipeline now calls DeepSomatic in chunks.

- v0.6.2:
  - Added experimental CHORD HRD (Homologous Recombination Deficiency) prediction. See [here](docs/output.md#homologous-recombination-deficiency-prediction) for details.
  - Renamed some variables (legacy Sniffles parameters).
  - Swap CNVkit visualization to Purple in report.
  - Made changes in WDL for compatibility with Cromwell.
  - Allow specifying min/max purity/ploidy for Purple (In task WDL)

- v0.6.1:
  - Updated documentation and benchmark.
  - Small bugfix in tabix indexing of VCFs.
  - Added HTML report for summary metrics.
  - Fixed a bug where germline VCFs are not output when using DeepSomatic.
  - Fixed a bug introduced in svpack filtering where entries with `SVLEN=0`.
    are filtered out (They should not be).
 
- v0.6:
  - Added DeepSomatic 1.6.0 (Experimental and disabled by default. Enable with `hifisomatic.use_deepsomatic` in input JSON). Note that DeepSomatic is computationally expensive compared to ClairS so we recommend disabling it if computational resources are limited. See benchmark [here](docs/benchmark.md) for comparison between ClairS and DeepSomatic.
  - Use `svpack` to filter for control SVs (previously using truvari) and provide simple annotation in filtered VCF.
  - Switch to using `samtools` to strip kinetics.

- v0.5:
  - Updated Cobalt to 4.0. It now counts read depth correctly. See [here](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/issues/485) for details.
  - Containers are now on pacbio quay.io.
  - SV calling now only uses Severus.
  - Individual tasks now output the version number in stdout.

- v0.4:
  - Added purity, ploidy and somatic CNV with Amber, Cobalt and Purple
    - Note that Cobalt doesn't count the read depth from long-reads correctly so
      it'll affect the segmentation accuracy. However, purity and ploidy
      estimation appears to be robust.
  - CNVKit segmentation results recalled with purity and ploidy estimate from Purple.
  - Severus release now updated with Bioconda container.
  - Fixed an issue when call_smallvariants is set to false (Issue #1).

- v0.3:
  - Added IntOGen filtering of SV/SNV/INDEL/DMR.
  - Added mutational signature analysis.
  - Added germline small variants annotation with VEP (optional).
  - Added Longphase as an optional phasing tool.
  - Better documentation of output in [output](docs/output.md).
  
- v0.2:
  - Downgraded to WDL 1.0 for better compatibility. 
  - Added run time attribute to tasks for future support on cloud (not tested yet).
  
- v0.1: Initial release.
